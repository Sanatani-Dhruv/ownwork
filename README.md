### Recommended Packages

- Since our OwnWork is really minimal Framework, you may require other packages for functionality like Database interactions.
- Recommendations are:
   - `delight-im/db`: For database interaction - [Github Link](https://github.com/delight-im/PHP-DB)
   - `phpunit/phpunit`: For testing - [Github Link](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit)
   - `illuminate/support`: For Illuminate Support like in Laravel
